<h1>Cricket DAO</h1>

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
A DAO for cricket lovers. The treasury could be used for giving away tickets to cricket matches, or even buying their own IPL Team!

Any member of the DAO can put out proposals and all the other members can vote YES or NO on the proposal. Each member holding BCCI Tokens gets one token. This is done to ensure everyone gets fair say in voting. 

<h3>Use Cases:</h3>
<li>Fans get their say in decisions(through voting)</li>

<h3>Future Plans:</h3>
<li>Adding more incentives to BCCI Token(example: special discount/seats to the member who are a part of the DAO for more than a particular time)</li>
<li>Improving Voting system</li>
<li>Introducing different tokens for IPL Teams bought by the DAO and giving those tokens the governance power for that particular IPL Team</li>
<li>Introducing Player NFTs and special moment NFTs</li>
<li>Converting the tickets sold by the DAO a NFT(in case of worldcup finals or special matches)</li>
